First of all it's necessary to specify that Ecommerce tracking stands for collecting and analyzing only purchase and transaction data. Ecommerce reports allow you to analyze purchase activity on your site. You can see product and transaction information, average order value, ecommerce conversion rate, time to purchase, and other purchase related data. Besides that you can analyze your customer traffic, adds strategy, email marketing, etc.

When you open Google Analytics home for the first time you'll see a screen like this

The default Google Analytics reports that you'll see on the homepage are most likely to be 
* User Traffic 
* How do you acquire users?
* How are your active users trending over time?
* How well do you retain users?
* When do your users visit?
* Where are your users?
* What are your top devices?
* What pages do your users visit?
* How are you performing against goals?
* What are your top selling products?

These reports will be based on the data submitted by our store to Google Analytics and will give you an insight into how your business is doing, who your customers are, where they’re coming from, and what they are buying.

All reports are joined into groups that are listed in the left column to your convenience: 
1. Real-time section shows you traffic and engagement figures on a live, real time basis.
2. Audience section covers data related to your audience’s location, browser, platform, demographics, and interests. You can also do cohort analysis and visualize your audience’s flow through your site.
3. Acquisition section shows you how and where did you get your customers (search, social, referrals, advertising, or direct visits).
4. Behavior section contains reports on the visitors' interaction with your site. You can learn what pages are most popular with your customers, get stats on the site events,etc.
5. Conversions section is useful for tracking conversion rates for your stated goals. 
  The **Conversions** -> **E-commerce** tab is where you can see the basic sales funnel reports based on a linear path to purchase logic. Here you can trace the standard % Completion and % Abandonment rates.

  Besides Shopping Behaviour you can also trace Checkout Behaviour, Sales Performance, Products Performance, etc.

These reports are incredibly powerful, but they don’t give you all the data you need at a glance. For that, you need a custom dashboard.
