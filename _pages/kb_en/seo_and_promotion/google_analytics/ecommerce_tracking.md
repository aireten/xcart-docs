First of all it's necessary to specify that Ecommerce tracking stands for collecting and analyzing only purchase and transaction data. The Ecommerce reports allow you to analyze purchase activity on your site. You can see product and transaction information, average order value, ecommerce conversion rate, time to purchase, and other purchase related data.

On a typical ecommerce site, once a user clicks the "purchase" button, the user's purchase information is sent to the web server, which carries out the transaction. If successful, the server redirects the user to a "Thank You" or receipt page with transaction details and a receipt of the purchase.
