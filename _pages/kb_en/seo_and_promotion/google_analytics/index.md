In order for your store to thrive and succeed in the eCommerce industry, you need to be able to make informed decisions: quick enough that you wonâ€™t be left out to dry, and sound enough that you can still afford to stay ahead of your competition. Decisions should be based on different statistics gathered through your store and it's rather difficult to trace all this info manually. Hence you'll need an instrument that will do this for you. 

X-Cart Is integrated with Google Analytics through the [Google Analytics](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/google-analytics.html "Google Analytics") module that is free and available in all X-Cart editions (Business, Multivendor and Ultimate). The module enables you to collect statistics on your eCommerce website and analyze the store traffic and marketing effectiveness. The gathered insights will help you to make the right improvements in your online store as it may have a lot of holes that are draining your bank account. If you don't spend time on analytics of the kind, the time will come that your eCommerce ship will sink drastically.

Analytics is a vital component of your responsibility as an eCommerce store merchant. Tracking eCommerce transactions in Google Analytics allows you to see the value of traffic by geography, keyword, referral, campaign, and many other dimensions. You can see eCommerce performance metrics on the Ecommerce tab of many reports. In addition, the Ecommerce reports provide information on product and sales performance, number of transactions, and time to purchase.

With Google Analytics, you are more prepared to write better-targeted ads, strengthen your marketing initiatives and create higher converting websites.
