## Activating addons

Sometimes the addon you want to use is installed, but not active. To be able to use such an addon, you need to activate it. 

To activate an installed addon:

1.  In your store's Admin area, click **My addons** to go to the **Installed Addons** section:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7503971/8716504.png)
2.  In this section, find the addon that needs to be activated (for example, **Add to Cart Popup**):
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7503971/8716505.png)
3.  Select the **Enabled **checkbox below its name:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7503971/8716506.png)
4.  Click the **Save changes** button at the bottom of the screen. This starts the activation process which may take a while to complete. After it is finished, the addon will be activated in your store and ready to use:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7503971/8716507.png)

## Deactivating addons

It is possible to temporarily disable (deactivate) an installed addon.

Note: Deactivation stops the addon from operation, but it does not remove the settings you made to the addon configuration nor clear any data that was generated or collected during the period that the addon was in operation. If you wish to completely remove all the data related to using a certain addon, you need to uninstall it.

To deactivate an installed addon:

1.  In the **Installed Addons** section of your store's Admin area, find the addon that needs to be deactivated.
2.  Unselect the **Enabled **checkbox below the addon name.
3.  Click **Save changes**. This starts the addon deactivation process. After it is finished, the addon will be disabled.
