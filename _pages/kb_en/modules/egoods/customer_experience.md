When a customer proceeds to checkout after adding a downloadable product to cart, there is no shipping section there if shipping for the product is disabled:

![checkout.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_208aL8a0/checkout.png)

After an order is placed, it gets the _Waiting for approve_ fulfilment status: 

![wfa-customer.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_208aL8a0/wfa-customer.png)

And a customer receives an {% link "e-mail notification" ref_5QLrLCu7 %} "Order waiting for approval":
![notification.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_208aL8a0/notification.png)

After the order fulfilment status is changed to any other except for _Will not deliver_ a download link is sent to a customer in the "Your order has been changed" e-mail notification:

![invoice-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_208aL8a0/invoice-1.png)

The download link for the product can also be found on the order details page in the **My orders** section of a customer account in your store.
