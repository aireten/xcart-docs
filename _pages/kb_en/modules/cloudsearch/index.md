CloudSearch is a SaaS solution that integrates with X-Cart to enable dynamic, real-time product search including autosuggest and spelling correct in an X-Cart based store. CloudSearch can be supplemented by CloudFilters to create a rich faceted search experience for your web store.

Unleash the power of enterprise-class search technologies! CloudSearch offers you full support for these features without the need to purchase a dedicated server ($100+/mo) or install special software ($500+).
