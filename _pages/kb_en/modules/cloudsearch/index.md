CloudSearch is a SaaS solution that integrates with X-Cart to enable dynamic, real-time product search including autosuggest and spelling correct in an X-Cart based store. CloudSearch can be supplemented by CloudFilters to create a rich faceted search experience for your web store. CloudFilters provides an efficient way to navigate through a large list of products to find items matching certain filtering criteria. Customers can express their search needs in a convenient and natural way â€” filter by price, category, brand, size, color or any other attribute they want.
