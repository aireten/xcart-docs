Promotions is a feature available to users on paid accounts. It allows the store administrator to promote specific products by prioritizing them among the search results for certain queries. To create a promotion, the administrator selects a product and links it to a query. As a result, the product appears on the first line of search results in the Products section of the CloudSearch widget.
