## Adding Products with PIN Codes

Adding a product with PIN codes is similar to adding an ordinary product described in {% link "Adding products" ref_fhzzxDTy %}. The only difference is that you must also generate PIN codes for the product using the _PIN Codes_ tab on the Product details page in the Admin/Provider area.

To assign a file to a product:
1. Create, import or clone a product as described in {% link "Adding products" ref_fhzzxDTy %}.
2. In the _Info_ tab of the Product details page locate the **Shipping** section and disable shipping for the product.

4. Save the changes.
