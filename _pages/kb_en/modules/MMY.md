The [Make/Model/Year module](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/make-model-year.html "Make/Model/Year Module") allows to set up 4 levels to filter the inventory, to remember the filters for the non-registered visitors and to remember the vehicle for the registered customers. Though the module is mainly aimed at the sellers of auto parts or/and moto parts, it can also be used by any seller who differentiates the products by levels like computers, copiers, smartphones, etc. 

To install the module follow the steps described in {% link "Activating and deactivating addons" ref_uEnDBBA7 %}. Once the module is installed and enabled, go to the module settings page to configure it.
