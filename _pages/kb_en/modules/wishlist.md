Wishlist allows any user to store any particular item in his cart which he/she may buy later by returning to your website. This saves your buyer's valuable time because the person doesn’t have to search for the product next time he visits the website. When a user doesn’t want to buy the product of his choice right at the moment, he can use the wishlist functionality. He may do this to wait for the upcoming discount offer. Also, this makes his search easier among huge amount of items. This counts for customer satisfaction and also increases the user friendliness of your website.

Offering wishlists is an effective way to reduce shopping cart abandonment and fulfill sales from customers who showed intent but didn't end up purchasing. Wishlists are mutually beneficial: they give customers an easy way to remind themselves of a product and help merchants measure product interest beyond a clear-cut sale.


With "My Wishlist" module enabled, your customers can collect their favourite products into a single list. They can buy these products later, track them in the catalog and email the list to friends.


Wishlist introduces your site to new customers and many of them may get converted to buyers (if they are referred to) as it also allows a person to send an email to his/her friends or relatives with the product details and buying option. This allows viral marketing for the your website as another person gets to know about your E-commerce website and products sold through it. With wishlist people get a chance to show the gift they want from other person.

Wish lists can encourage users to sign up for an account who wouldn't have otherwise.
