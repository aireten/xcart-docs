The 'Spend X Get Y' module works with a cart subtotal and gives a customer a discount if a certain subtotal is met. Unlike regular discounts or sales the module encourages customers to spend more to win a price. The Spend X Get Y offer is especially good when you need to force sales regardless of particular SKUs. 

The module is included into the Ultimate software package. If you run Business, you can buy the [Special Offers: Spend X Get Y](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/spend-x-get-y.html "Special Offers: Spend X Get Y") module and install it as described in {% link "How to Install Modules in X-Cart 5" ref_fTUahl4n %}. 

Once installed the module functionality will become available in the 'Discounts: Special Offers' section of the cart admin area (Figure 1). Along with the module itself you'll see a 'Sample: Spend $100 and get 50% off the cheapest' that illustrates the basic configuration principles.

Let's consider the sample to understand how the Spend X Get Y offer works. 

First comes the 'General Options' section (Figure 2) where you can define the administrative name, i.e. the name of the offer how the cart admin sees it in the list of offers (https://www.yourstore.com/admin.php?target=special_offers). The offer type 'Spend X Get M of items discounted/free' is preset as it was defined when an offer was created (refer to _**Create**_ on Figure 1).

Also, in the 'Geneal Options' section you can enable or disable the offer. 

{% note info %}
It's also possible to enable/disable an offer directly on the listing page (Figure 3) via a special 'Enable/Disable' button. When the offer is enabled the button is green, when disabled - grey.

After _**General Options**_ comes the 'Dates' section (Figure 4).

![Fig 4]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/dates.png)

In this section tha cart admin can define the dates the offer will start and end at. If the dates are not defined the offer will be open-ended. 

When the dates are defined you can proceed to _**Conditions**_, the section that is literary a heart of the offer as here a cart admin defines a subtotal the offer will be applied to (it is  $100 in the sample), the category(s) and the membership(s) (Figure 5).

To set a particular category or categories the offer will be applied to the admin will need to choose them from the list of all categories and subcategories available in the store. If the offer is store-wide no selection is required.

{% note info %} Hold Shift to choose more than one category. Subcategories are marked with '---' in the list
