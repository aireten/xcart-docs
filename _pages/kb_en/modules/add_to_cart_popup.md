The module displays a popup showing what has just been added to the shopping cart and offering a list of "You may also like" product recommendations when a customer clicks the "Buy now"/ "Add to cart" button or when he adds the item to cart drag 'n' dropping it. From the popup, your customers can add a recommended product to the shopping cart, proceed directly to checkout, continue shopping or go to the shopping cart page.
