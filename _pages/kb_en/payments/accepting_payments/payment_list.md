X-Cart supports two types of payment methods:

1.  _Offline_ payment methods (methods that allow customers to check out without submitting payment information). For example, Phone Ordering, Check, Money Order, Wire Transfer, COD etc.
2.  _Online_ payment methods (methods that allow customers to enter their payment information online, so you automatically receive the payment via the respective payment system). For example, Paypal, Authorize.Net, 2Checkout, Skrill, etc.

On the **Payment settings** page, online payment methods can be found in the **Online methods** section. Offline payment methods can be found in the section **Offline methods** (You may need to scroll down the **Payment settings** page to be able to see it):

The INACTIVE/ACTIVE switch displayed for every item on the list of payment methods can be used to control the availability of the method to customers:

ACTIVE (green icon) = the method is available on the storefront;
INACTIVE (gray icon) = the method is not available (not visible to customers).

The **Configure** button below each payment method name allows you to access the payment method settings:
