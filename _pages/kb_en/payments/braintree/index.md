An X-Cart store can be integrated with [Braintree, A PayPal Service](https://www.braintreepayments.com/). Currently, there are two Braintree integration modules available in the X-Cart Marketplace:
   
   * **[PayPal powered by Braintree](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/paypal-powered-by-braintree.html)** 
   * **[Braintree payment gateway](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/braintree-for-xcart5.html)**

The module "PayPal powered by Braintree" is the newer of the two. It is the most advanced payment solution from PayPal to date, and it is based on the latest Braintree API. 
The module "Braintree payment gateway" is an older version of the integration based on an earlier version of Braintree API. 
Because the new API (the one used by "PayPal powered by Braintree") is currently available only to users in the USA, UK, France, Italy and Spain we are keeping the module "Braintree payment gateway" available to X-Cart customers through the Marketplace as it uses an API available in many more countries. 

Depending on the X-Cart version you are using, a Braintree integration module may already be installed in your X-Cart store:

If not, you can obtain it from the X-Cart Marketplace at any time:

To accept payments with Braintree, you will need a Braintree or PayPal account. If you do not yet have one, you will be able to sign up in the process of setting up the Braintree integration for your store.
