This section will help you to set up your webstore based on your country localization parameters.

{% note info %}
If you want the prices currency to be displayed depending on a customer's location use the {% link "Multicurrency Module" ref_2tPJubPU %}
{% endnote %}

1.  Go to the Localization section of your store's Admin area (**Store setup** > **Localization**).
    ![localization.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_cc4sCpa5/localization.png)

2.  Use the settings in this section to define the localization parameters for your country:
    *   **Weight unit** : This setting defines the main weight unit that will be used in your store to measure the weight of products, shiping boxes, etc. You can choose between LB (pound(s)) / OZ (ounce(s)) / KG (kilogram) / G (gram)
    *   **Weight symbol** : The field is updated automatically depending on the chosen Weight Unit.
    *   **Hide trailing zeros in fractional part** : If enabled weight is displayed as a whole number (1) instead of a fractional number (1.00) in the customer storefront. Weight is always displayed as a fractional number (1.00) in the admin area.
    *   **Weight format** : This setting defines how weight is displayed in the customer storefront. 
    *   **Dimensional unit** : This setting defines the main dimentional unit that will be used in your store to measure the size of products, shiping boxes, etc. You can choose between - MM (millimeter(s)) / CM (centimeter(s)) / DM (decimeter(s)) / M ( meter(s)) / IN (inch(es))
    *   **Dimensional symbol** : The field is updated automatically depending on the chosen Weight Format.
    *   **Date format** : This setting defines how date is displayed in the store. 
    *   **Time format** : This setting defines how time is displayed in the store.
    *   **Time zone** : This setting defines the time zone your store geographically belongs to. 
    *   **CSV column delimiter** : This setting defines what sign should be used in a CSV file to delimit columns if you use any text editor instead of a speadsheet editor.
    *   **Import/export charset** : This setting defines a charset used for an import/export CSV file.
3.  Once you are done, click **Submit** at the bottom of the page to save the changes.
