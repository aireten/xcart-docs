Once you download X-Cart from [www.x-cart.com](http://www.x-cart.com/) and install it on your server, you get a store builder with the user interface displayed in the English language. 

However, you can turn your X-Cart into a truly multi-language solution by installing language translation addons. For example, there are some language translations that you can download from X-Cart Marketplace, including:

*   Russian
*   French
*   German
*   Dutch
*   British English

If you want to translate X-Cart into a language for which no translation is available in the X-Cart Marketplace, contact us at {% link "developers@x-cart.com" mailto:developers@x-cart.com %}. We will explain how this can be done and how you can get money out of it.

Below are some guides on how to translate your store into another language:
