If necessary you can add a PDF version of invoices to the e-mail notifications using the **Attachments** tab of the **Store setup** -> **Email notifications** page.

PDF invoices will be added as an attachment to all order related notifications.

{% note info %}
You can extend the default PDF invoices feature with a paid [PDF Invoice](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/PDF-Invoice.html "eMail Notifications: Set Up and Maintenance") module that is more flexible and powerful.
