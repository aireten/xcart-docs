Once a new X-Cart version is released, upgrades to this version become available to existing X-Cart clients in two "waves". By implementing the "waves", we're ensuring more thorough testing of the upgrade process.

The first wave is the so-called **Developer wave**; this wave becomes available at the time of official X-Cart release announcement and is intended for X-Cart developers/early adopters. This wave allows 3rd party module developers to adapt their modules to the new X-Cart core; it also lets tech-savvy X-Cart users to try the upgrade and make sure it does not cause issues in their specific store environment.

The second wave is the **Merchant wave**; this wave typically becomes available in 2-7 days following the official release announcement and is intented for all X-Cart clients. 

The Developer wave provides access to new X-Cart features earlier. However, upgrading in the Developer wave may be recommended only for users prepared to deal with upgrade issues, should any such issues arise. 

By default, all new X-Cart installations are configured to get upgrades in the Merchant wave. If you need access to new X-Cart releases in the Developer wave, you will want to switch your **Upgrade access level** to  Developer in the Upgrade options section of your store's Admin area (**System settings** > **Environment**).
