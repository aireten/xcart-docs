# Use Memberships to Promote Sales

So how can you benefit from using memberships? Memberships are commonly used for:
- deviding customers in groups (wholesale, retail, etc.) as described in [User membership levels] (https://kb.x-cart.com/users/user_membership_levels.html)
- giving customers tax-exempt status
- creating discounts for certain memberships

You can also provide special payment options for certain groups of customers or even sell memberships to the customers for gaining access to better prices. Hence you can not only promote sales with memberships but also earn on them.

## Memberships for Products and Categories

In [Setting up wholesale prices and minimum purchase quantites for different membership levels](https://kb.x-cart.com/products/setting_up_wholesale_prices_and_minimum_purchase_quantites_for_different_membership_levels.html) you've learned how to give special prices to the customers who buy bulk items. Setting memberships on a certain product, groups of products or even categories works a bit different. Using this function you can grant access to items to particular members of your site only and hide such items from the unregistered visitors.
