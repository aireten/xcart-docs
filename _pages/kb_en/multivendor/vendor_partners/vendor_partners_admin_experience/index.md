The administrator of a multivendor X-Cart store can activate the addon **Multiple profiles for vendors** via the **My addons** section of the X-Cart store Admin area.

After the activation of the addon, the administrator will find a new role added to the list of user roles in the Roles section (**Users** > **Roles**) - the role "Vendor staff":
![mvp_vendor_staff_role.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_7EtCK0bR/mvp_vendor_staff_role.png)

This role corresponds to a set of access permissions that enable a user to access the working area of a specific vendor and perform operations in that area on behalf of the vendor. The exact scope of access permissions that a user with this role gets (full or limited) is defined by the vendor. 

Any users with this role in the store's user list are vendor staff members:

Note that being the primary feature of the addon the role "Vendor staff" may not be removed. If necessary, however, the store administrator can rename it:
