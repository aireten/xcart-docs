If the vendors of a multivendor store require help of other people in their own vendor area (for example, if they want a staff member or a business partner of theirs to be able to log in to the store and add/update their products or work on the orders), the store administrator may choose to activate the addon **Multiple profiles for vendors**. 

The addon enables a new user role - "Vendor staff" - which can be given to the staff or business partners of exiting vendors so they can access the products and orders of the vendor.

The vendors themselves decide on whom they want to invite to the store as vendor staff members. The store administrator does not have to worry about sending the invitations or approving the new staff users: these tasks are performed by the vendors. The administrator, however, can rename the role "Vendor staff" (the same way as any other role in the store) and can manage the profiles of vendor staff users like any other user profile in the store.

The invitation email message used to invite new vendor staff members to the store is a regular X-Cart notification. After activating the addon, the store administrator should check and adjust this message via the Email notifications section.

Read on to find out how a store administrator can:

   * Activate the addon "Multiple profiles for vendors" to enable the creation of additional (vendor staff) profiles by vendors.

   * Edit the user role "Vendor staff", if necessary.

   * Find out if a certain user is a vendor staff member.
        See {% link "Multiple profiles for vendors: Identifying vendor staff users" ref_386bKin8 %}
        
   * Adjust the email message that will be sent to the new staff member users when a vendor invites them to work on the store.
