The store administrator can adjust the email message by which new vendor staff members are invited to log in to their store profile for the first time. The vendor staff invitation message can be found in the Email notifications section of the store's Admin area (**Store setup** > **Email notifications**). The content of the invitation can be adjusted as that of any other X-Cart notification.
