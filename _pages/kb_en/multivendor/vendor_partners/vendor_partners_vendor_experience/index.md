In a multivendor X-Cart store with the addon **Multiple profiles for vendors** installed and enabled, vendors can invite other people (staff members, business partners, etc.) to help them work on their products and orders in their own vendor area. To enable the access of other people to their vendor area, a vendor needs to create vendor staff profiles for such users and to invite them to join their operating area as vendor staff members.  

To create a new vendor staff profile, a vendor needs to use the Vendor staff members tab of their account info (**My account** > **Staff members**):
![mvp_myaccount_staffmembers.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6X7UpEq6/mvp_myaccount_staffmembers.png)

On that tab, they need to click the **Add staff member** button:
![mvp_staffmembers_add_new.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6X7UpEq6/mvp_staffmembers_add_new.png)

A new blank Email field will be provided on the screen:
![mvp_staffmembers_add_new1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6X7UpEq6/mvp_staffmembers_add_new1.png)

The vendor needs to use that field to enter the email address of the person who needs to be given vendor staff access. This needs to be a valid email address as it will be used to send an invitation to the user with a link for access to the vendor area; the user will have to use that link to complete the setup of their profile as a staff member.

Before saving the new user profile, the vendor also needs to set the desired access level for it by adjusting the Full access switch.

If necessary, more than one staff members can be added at once: every click of the **Add staff member** button creates an additional blank line for a new vendor staff member profile:
![mvp_staffmembers_add_new2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6X7UpEq6/mvp_staffmembers_add_new2.png)

After adding all the staff email addresses they requie and setting the access levels, the vendor needs to click the **Save changes** button.
