To create a new vendor staff profile, a vendor needs to use the Vendor staff members tab of their account info (**My account** > **Staff members**):
![mvp_myaccount_staffmembers.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6X7UpEq6/mvp_myaccount_staffmembers.png)

On that tab, they need to click the **Add staff member** button:

A new blank Email field will be provided on the screen:
![mvp_staffmembers_add_new1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6X7UpEq6/mvp_staffmembers_add_new1.png)

The vendor needs to use that field to enter the email address of the person who needs to be given vendor staff access. This needs to be a valid email address as it will be used to send an invitation to the user with a link for access to the vendor area; the user will have to use that link to complete the setup of their profile as a staff member.

Before saving the new user profile, the vendor also needs to set the desired access level for the user by adjusting the Full access switch for their profile. Vendor staff users with Full access will have exactly the same access permissions as the vendor themselves; they will be able to see and edit any data in the vendor account including vendor details, staff and financial info. Vendor staff without Full access will be able to access the products, shipping settings, orders and commissons of the vendor, but they will not have access to vendor details, staff and financial info.

If necessary, the vendor can add more than one staff members at once: every click of the **Add staff member** button creates an additional blank line for a new vendor staff member profile:
![mvp_staffmembers_add_new2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6X7UpEq6/mvp_staffmembers_add_new2.png)

After adding all the staff email addresses they require and setting the access levels, the vendor needs to click the **Save changes** button. This will create the new vendor staff profile(s).
