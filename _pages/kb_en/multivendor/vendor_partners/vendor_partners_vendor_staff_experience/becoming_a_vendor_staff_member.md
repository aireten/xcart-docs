When an existing vendor wants to invite another user to work on the products and orders in their dedicated vendor area as a staff member, they create a user profile for them and send an invitation to their email address. The new user has to accept the invitation to get the role of a vendor staff member.Here's how it is done:

Each vendor staff invitation contains a link that the new user can useto access the store. When they follow this link, they are provided with access to a registration form where they can set up their password.

After submitting a password and a password confirmation, the user is thanked for the registration and is prompted to accept the invitation confirming their status as staff:

As soon as the new user clicks the **Confirm** button, the invitation will be marked as accepted in the Admin area
