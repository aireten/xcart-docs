In a multivendor X-Cart store with the addon **Multiple profiles for vendors** installed and enabled, a new type of X-Cart store users is added: vendor staff members. Users of this type are added by existing vendors to enable access of their own staff members or business partners to the dedicated area of the store in which they work on their products and orders.
