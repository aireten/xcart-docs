In a multivendor X-Cart store with the addon **Multiple profiles for vendors** installed and enabled, vendors can invite other people (staff members, business partners, etc.) to help them work on their products and orders in their own vendor area. To enable the access of other people to their vendor area, a vendor needs to create vendor staff profiles for such users and to invite them to join their operating area as vendor staff members.  

Read on to find out how a vendor can:

   * Create a new vendor staff profile;
   * Invite a new vendor staff member to log in.
   
## Creating new vendor staff profiles
To create a new vendor staff profile, a vendor needs to use the Vendor staff members tab of their account info (**My account** > **Staff members**):
![mvp_myaccount_staffmembers.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6X7UpEq6/mvp_myaccount_staffmembers.png)

On that tab, they need to click the **Add staff member** button:
![mvp_staffmembers_add_new.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6X7UpEq6/mvp_staffmembers_add_new.png)

A new blank Email field will be provided on the screen:
![mvp_staffmembers_add_new1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6X7UpEq6/mvp_staffmembers_add_new1.png)

The vendor needs to use that field to enter the email address of the person who needs to be given vendor staff access. This needs to be a valid email address as it will be used to send an invitation to the user with a link for access to the vendor area; the user will have to use that link to complete the setup of their profile as a staff member.

Before saving the new user profile, the vendor also needs to set the desired access level for the user by adjusting the Full access switch for their profile. Vendor staff users with Full access will have exactly the same access permissions as the vendor themselves; they will be able to see and edit any data in the vendor account including vendor details, staff and financial info. Vendor staff without Full access will be able to access the products, shipping settings, orders and commissons of the vendor, but they will not have access to vendor details, staff and financial info.

If necessary, the vendor can add more than one staff members at once: every click of the **Add staff member** button creates an additional blank line for a new vendor staff member profile:
![mvp_staffmembers_add_new2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6X7UpEq6/mvp_staffmembers_add_new2.png)

After adding all the staff email addresses they require and setting the access levels, the vendor needs to click the **Save changes** button. This will create the new vendor staff profile(s).

## Inviting new vendor staff members to log in
Once a new vendor staff profile has been created, the vendor needs to send an invitation to the staff member so they can log in to their profile and begin their work. To send an invitation, the vendor uses the "Send" link provided on the line of the respective vendor staff profile:
![mvp_invitation_send_link.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6X7UpEq6/mvp_invitation_send_link.png)

Once an invitation has been sent, the "Send" link changes to "Re-send": 
![mvp_invitation_sent.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6X7UpEq6/mvp_invitation_sent.png)

The vendor can use the "Re-send" link to send the invitation once again. This may be helpful if the original invitation is not received, lost or deleted by the recipient.

The invitation that is sent to new vendor staff members contains a link they should use to log in to the store and complete their registration. Once a new vendor staff member has used that link and logged in, the invitation status will be updated to "Accepted":
![mvp_invitation_accepted.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6X7UpEq6/mvp_invitation_accepted.png)
The vendor will be able to see the date and time of the invitation acceptance.
