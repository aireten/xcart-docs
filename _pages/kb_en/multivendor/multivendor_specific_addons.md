X-Cart Multivendor edition is X-Cart Business extended with a bunch of Multivendor-specific addons. These addons modify a regular X-Cart Business store transforming it into a marketplace that can be used simultaneously by multiple sellers. 

The most important addon of this bunch is **Multi-vendor**. Is is the core of the Multivendor package which introduces a new type of X-Cart users - "vendors", an interface for vendor registration and approval, an option for the store administrator to choose one of two store operation modes (Warehouse/Vendors as separate shops), a dedicated area of the store back end where vendors can manage their product catalog and get access to orders, payment transactions and statistics, and so on.

There are also a few other addons recommended for use with X-Cart Multivendor. Some of them are strictly specific to the Multivendor package because they depend on the core Multi-vendor addon and cannot be used without it (like **Trusted/Non-trusted vendors**). Others are addons that have Multivendor related features (like **Order messages**):

   * **Trusted/Non-trusted vendors**: The module enables the store administrator to mark vendors as trusted and non-trusted. Any products added by vendors with the status "trusted" will be visible to your store visitors right away, whereas the products of non-trusted vendors will appear on the storefront only after they have been approved by the administrator.

   * **Order messages**: The module enhances the communication system in your store by providing an opportunity for the customers, the store administrator and the vendors to start a conversation or dispute about an order right from the Order details page.

If any module of the Multivendor package that you are looking to use is not installed in your store, check the X-Cart’s Marketplace.
