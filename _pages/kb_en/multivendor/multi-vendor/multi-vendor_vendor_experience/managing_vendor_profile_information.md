Vendor can access their user profile by clicking on the user icon in the header of the store's back end and selecting the **Profile settings** item from the menu:

The **Account details** section of the profile settings allows vendor to view general information about their account and manage such information as their account email address and password:

The **Address book** section can be used by vendor to enter and store their name and addresses:

Note that this section is intended for the personal address(es) of the seller. The address that will be used to calculate the cost of shipping of goods from the seller's warehouse to the buyer in the "Vendors as separate shops" multivendor mode can be entered using the Store address section (**Store setup** > **Store address**). 

The **Vendor details **section is where vendor can provide general information about their business.

The following information can be provided:

*   *   **Company name**: Name by which store visitors will identify the vendor. 
    *   **CleanURL**: Human readable and SEO friendly web address for the vendor profile page in the Customer area.
    *   **Image**: Vendor image.
    *   **Location**: Vendor location.
    *   **Description**: Vendor description for the vendor profile page.

The** Financial info** section is where vendor can specify an account that they wish to use to accept money from sales through this store.

This can be either a PayPal account or a bank account. If the store uses PayPal Adaptive payments, specifying a PayPal account in the vendor's financial info will allow them to be paid automatically on each sale made through the store. The details of the vendor's bank account are not used by X-Cart, but they are visible to the storefront operator - represented by the account of the store admin - who can use these details to transfer the funds they owe to the seller outside X-Cart.
