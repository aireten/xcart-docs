## Account details
A vendor user can access the general information about their account and edit their account email address and password via the Account details section. This section can be accessed using one of the following methods:

   * By clicking on the user icon in the header of the store's back end and selecting **My profile**:

   * By clicking **My account** and selecting **Account details**:

## Address book
A vendor can specify their name and address(es) in the Address book section (**My account**>**Account details**, **Address book** tab):
     ![xc5_mv_vendor_address_book.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_b7PTQMgf/xc5_mv_vendor_address_book.png)

Note that this section is intended for the personal address(es) of the seller. The address that will be used to calculate the cost of shipping from the vendor's warehouse to the buyer in the "Vendors as separate shops" multivendor mode should be specified in the Company address section (**My account** > **Company address**). 

## Company details
A vendor should provide general information about their business in the **Company details** section:
     ![xc5_mv_my_account_vendor_company_details.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_b7PTQMgf/xc5_mv_my_account_vendor_company_details.png)

   * **Company name**: Name by which store visitors will identify the vendor. 
   * **CleanURL**: Human readable and SEO friendly web address for the vendor profile page in the Customer area.
   * **Image**: Vendor image.
   * **Location**: Vendor location.
   * **Description**: Vendor description for the vendor profile page.
    
## Company address
A vendor should specify their company address. The vendor company address may be specified during vendor registration or entered directly in the Company address section of the Vendor area (**My account** > **Company address**). In the "Vendors as separate shops" multivendor mode, this address is used to calculate the cost of shipping from the vendor's warehouse to the buyer.

## Financial info
A vendor should specify an account that they wish to use to accept money from the sales through the multivendor marketplace in the **Financial info** section (**My account** > **Financial info**).
     ![xc5_mv_my_account_financial.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_b7PTQMgf/xc5_mv_my_account_financial.png)

This can be either a PayPal account or a bank account. If the store uses PayPal Adaptive payments, specifying a PayPal account in the vendor's financial info will allow the vendor to be paid automatically on each sale made through the store. The details of the vendor's bank account are not used by X-Cart, but they are visible to the store owner/storefront operator (represented by the account of the store administrator) who can use these details to transfer the funds they owe to the seller using means outside X-Cart.
