In X-Cart Multivendor, vendors must pay a commission for using the storefront. The commission rates are set by the store administrator acting on behalf of the store owner/storefront operator. It is possible to set commission rates that will be used globally for all the vendors or to set individual commission rates on a per-vendor basis.
