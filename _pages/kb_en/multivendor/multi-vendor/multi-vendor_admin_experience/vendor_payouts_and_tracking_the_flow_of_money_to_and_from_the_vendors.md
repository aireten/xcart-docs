In an X-Cart-based multivendor store/online marketplace, the store owner/storefront operator must ensure that the money earned by the vendors on product sales through the store/marketplace successfully reaches the respective vendors. The distribution of the earnings from product sales among all the participants (the vendors and the store owner/storefront operator) can be done:
   
   * automatically (through the use of payment methods supporting automated distribution, like {% link "PayPal Adaptive Payments" ref_FdXWLwVN %};
   * manually (by the store owner/storefront operator - using means outside X-Cart). 

No matter which of the above methods is used to distribute the money, the store administrator acting on behalf of the store owner/storefront operator has a way to track the money flow right in the X-Cart Admin area - through the section Vendor transactions (**Orders** > **Vendor transactions**):

In the case of automated distribution, the transactions reflecting the movement of the money are generated and registered in this section automatically. In the case of manual distribution, the store administrator uses this section to manually register any transactions taking place between the store owner/storefront operator and each of the vendors.

Let us take a closer look at how to use the Vendor transactions section.
