In an X-Cart-based multivendor store/online marketplace, the store owner/storefront operator must ensure that the money earned by the vendors on product sales through the store/marketplace successfully reaches the respective vendors. The distribution of the earnings from product sales among all the participants (the vendors and the store owner/storefront operator) can be done:
   
   * automatically (through the use of payment methods supporting automated distribution, like {% link "PayPal Adaptive Payments" ref_FdXWLwVN %};
   * manually (by the store owner/storefront operator - using means outside X-Cart).
