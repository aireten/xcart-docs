## Adding new vendors via the Admin area

The store administrator can create user profiles for vendor users via the Users section of the store's Admin area.

To create a new vendor profile, the administrator does one of the following: 

*   creates a new user profile with the access level "Vendor":
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8749143/8719604.png)
*   creates a new user profile with the access level "Admin" and the role "Vendor":
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8749143/8716890.png)

With this method, a new vendor user is created right away:
    ![xc5_multi-vendor_profile_created.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_SkW62BgH/xc5_multi-vendor_profile_created.png)

The new vendor can log in and start selling immediately after the creation of their profile.

## Editing vendor profiles

If a vendor of yours requests changing some of their profile information (for example, if your vendor sells their business and the change of the business owner needs to be reflected in the vendor profile details), you can edit the respective vendor profile via the Users section of your store's Admin area.

## Removing vendors

If you need to discontinue access of one of your vendors to the marketplace, you can remove their user profile via the Users section of your store's Admin area.
