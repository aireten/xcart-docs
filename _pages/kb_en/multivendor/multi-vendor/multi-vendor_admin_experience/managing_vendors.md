## Approving/rejecting vendor applications

A user who wants to become a new vendor on the marketplace can submit an application via the Become a seller page in the Customer area. When this happens, the store administrator is notified of the new vendor registration via a bell notification and an email notification sent to their inbox. The administrator needs to review this application and either approve or reject it.

To do so, the administrator needs to find the profile of the user who has applied to become a vendor in the Users section of the store's Admin area (They will have a regular user profile record in the store's user list):
![xc5_mv_unapproved_vendor_list1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_SkW62BgH/xc5_mv_unapproved_vendor_list1.png)

After reviewing the user profile of the prospective vendor, the administrator needs to approve or reject the application using the buttons **Approve vendor** / **Decline vendor**:

## Adding new vendors via the Admin area

The store administrator can create user profiles for vendor users via the Users section of the store's Admin area.

To create a new vendor profile, the administrator does one of the following: 

*   creates a new user profile with the access level "Vendor":
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8749143/8719604.png)
*   creates a new user profile with the access level "Admin" and the role "Vendor":
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/8749143/8716890.png)

With this method, a new vendor user is created right away:
    ![xc5_multi-vendor_profile_created.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_SkW62BgH/xc5_multi-vendor_profile_created.png)

The new vendor can log in and start selling immediately after the creation of their profile.

## Editing vendor profiles

If a vendor of yours requests changing some of their profile information (for example, if your vendor sells their business and the change of the business owner needs to be reflected in the vendor profile details), you can edit the respective vendor profile via the Users section of your store's Admin area.

## Removing vendors

If you need to discontinue access of one of your vendors to the marketplace, you can remove their user profile via the Users section of your store's Admin area.
