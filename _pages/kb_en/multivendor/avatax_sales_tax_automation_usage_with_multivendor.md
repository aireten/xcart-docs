The addon {% link "AvaTax Sales Tax Automation" ref_6880bVvi %} can be used with X-Cart Multivendor:
   
   * no matter whether the store's Multivendor mode has been set to "Warehouse" or "Vendors as separate shops";
   * no matter whether tax collection has been set up as the responsibility of the site owner or of the vendors. 

In stores where the collection of taxes has been configured as the responsibility of the vendors, tax calculation with {% link "Sales tax" ref_aJPK4DHN %}, {% link "VAT/GST" ref_Rzp45QlN %} or {% link "Canadian taxes" ref_hxmof6xX %} is not supported. Avatax, however, can be used. 

To use AvaTax Sales Tax Automation, the store administrator will have to get an AvaTax account first. Then they will have to adjust the settings on the AvaTax Sales Tax Automation addon settings page.

When the addon "AvaTax Sales Tax Automation" is used in the "Vendors as separate shops" multivendor mode, the store administrator can limit the set of US states for which a request for tax rates may be sent by the store. This can be done using the setting "Calculate taxes for US in designated states only" on the settings page of the AvaTax Sales Tax Automation addon:

and on the Financial details tab of the vendor profile (See the section "US tax calculation").
