From the viewpoint of X-Cart 5 user access levels, a vendor user is an administrator with the role "Vendor". This means that vendors are allowed to log in to the store's back end, but have access only to a limited set of features.

The URL for vendor login is the same as for all administrator users:

`http://<your-domain>/<x-cart-5-directory>/admin.php?target=login`

(TheÂ `http://<your-domain>/<x-cart-5-directory>` portion needs to be replaced with the actual address of your X-Cart 5 store).
