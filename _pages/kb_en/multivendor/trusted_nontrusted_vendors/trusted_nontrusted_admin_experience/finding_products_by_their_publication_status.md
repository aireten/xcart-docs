The store administrator can filter/search for vendor products by their publication status. To do so, they need to do a product search in the store's Admin area specifying the product publication status they require in the **Approve status** field. The **Approve status** field is a a drop-down selector with the following options:
   * _Any approve status_ (Any matching products will be found, regardess of their publication status)
   * _Only approved_ (Only matching products with the status "Product is approved" will be found)
   * _Only unapproved_ (Only matching products with the statuses "Product is sent for approval" and "Product is declined" will be found)
   * _Only sent for approval_ (Only matching products with the status "Product is sent for approval" will be found)
   * _Only declined_ (Only matching products with the status "Product is declined" will be found)
