If the owner/administrator of a multivendor X-Cart store wishes to be able to review the content of new product pages created by vendors before such pages get published,on the storefront, they can enable the addon **Trusted/Non-trusted vendors**.

In a multivendor X-Cart store/online marketplace with the addon **Trusted/Non-trusted vendors** installed and active, the store administrator will be able to give individual vendors a trusted/non-trusted status. Trusted vendors will be able to add new products to the product catalog without moderation; non-trusted vendors will have to submit new products for approval by the store administrator before these products get published. 

The store administrator will be notified of new products submitted for approval and will be able to either approve or decline the publication of the respective product pages. They will also be able to add comments for the vendor if the publication is declined.

Find out how a store administrator can:

   * Activate the addon "Trusted/Non-trusted vendors" to enable the moderation of new products added by individual vendors.   
     See {% link "Activating the Trusted/Non-trusted vendors addon" ref_6jpz9PXe %}
   
   * Give individual vendors a trusted/non-trusted status to specify who can add new products to the catalog without moderation, and who must submit new products for approval by the store administrator before they get published.
     See {% link "Managing the trusted/non-trusted status of vendors" ref_2ETaFqTV %}
   
   * Approve or decline the publishing of new products created by non-trusted vendors.
