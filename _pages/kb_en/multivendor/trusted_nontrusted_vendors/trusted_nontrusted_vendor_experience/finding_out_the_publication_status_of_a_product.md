In a multivendor X-Cart store where the storefront operator/store administrator has enabled moderation for the content of new vendor-created product pages using the addon **Trusted/Non-trusted vendors**, vendors can find out the publication status of any of their products. To find out the publication status of a product, a vendor should find the product in the Vendor area and open its details for viewing/editing. The publication status of the product is shown in the lower part of the Info section of the product details.

The following statuses are supported:

   * Product is unapproved
   * Product is sent for approval
   * Product is declined
   * Product is approved
