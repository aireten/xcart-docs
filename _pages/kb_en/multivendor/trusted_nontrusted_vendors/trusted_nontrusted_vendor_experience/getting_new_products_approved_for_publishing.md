In a multivendor X-Cart store with the addon **Trusted/Non-trusted vendors** installed and active, trusted vendors can add their products without an approval from the storefront operator/store administrator. Non-trusted vendors, however, have to submit new products for approval before they get published on the storefront.

Once a new product is created by a non-trusted vendor, the vendor sees a panel in the lower part of the Info section of the product page in the Vendor area displaying the product status as "Product is unapproved". The vendor can submit the product for approval by clicking the **Send for approval** button on the same panel:
![tnt_unapproved_product.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4NXPSgua/tnt_unapproved_product.png)

Once this happens, the status of the product is updated to "Product is sent for approval":
![tnt_product_sent_4_approval.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4NXPSgua/tnt_product_sent_4_approval.png)
