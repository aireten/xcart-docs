The Messages module saves your customers from the necessity to search for contact info and fill in contact forms. With this module they can get in touch with the store admin and/or the vendor of an ordered item in one click directly from the order details page.

In case a customer is not satisfied with the ordered item or with communication with a vendor or whatever else, he can open a dispute to get in touch with the store administrator. 


Fully compatible with multi-vendor modes


Excellent notification system to guarantee well-timed responses
When a customer gets a new message from a seller, there appears a special icon in the header in customer area.
