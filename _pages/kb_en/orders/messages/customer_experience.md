Key features
Enhanced customer experience
Save your customers from the necessity to search for contact info or filling in contact forms. With this module they can get in touch with you or the vendor of an ordered item in one click directly from the order details page. 
Disputes available for better control over conflict cases
In case a customer is not satisfied with communication with a vendor, he can open a dispute to get in touch with the store administrator. Also, a dispute can be opened by a store administrator to cut into the messaging between a vendor and a customer and get notifications for this conversation.
Fully compatible with multi-vendor modes


Excellent notification system to guarantee well-timed responses
When a customer gets a new message from a seller, there appears a special icon in the header in customer area.
