It's not a secret that accurate customer care, offering an easy and convenient way to reach the store owner and the vendors selling in the store give customers confidence in your business and cheer them to spend more. X-Cart has a special instrument to make communication between customers and store owners and vendors fast and handy.

The [Messages](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/order-messages.html "Messages Module") module allows both a customer and a seller to start a conversation related to the order right on the order details page, and well-thought notification system won’t leave any message unread. Messaging related to orders is available in all paid editions (X-Cart Business, X-Cart Multivendor, X-Cart Ultimate). 

If you have Multi-vendor functionality enabled, the Messages addon also allows your buyers to start messaging with sellers before they make a purchase. They can initiate the conversations right on the sellers' pages in the storefront. 

_In this section:_
* Messages Module: Admin Experience
* Messages Module: Customer Experience

Key features
Enhanced customer experience
Save your customers from the necessity to search for contact info or filling in contact forms. With this module they can get in touch with you or the vendor of an ordered item in one click directly from the order details page. In “Warehouse mode” if both messaging with the store administrator and vendors is enabled, a customer can choose whom he wants to communicate with.
Disputes available for better control over conflict cases
In case a customer is not satisfied with communication with a vendor, he can open a dispute to get in touch with the store administrator. Also, a dispute can be opened by a store administrator to cut into the messaging between a vendor and a customer and get notifications for this conversation.
Fully compatible with multi-vendor modes
In “Vendors as separate shops” mode vendors communicate with customers themselves and get only the messages related to their orders.
In “Warehouse” mode it’s a store administrator who handles communication with customers by default, however communication with vendors can also be enabled.
Excellent notification system to guarantee well-timed responses
When a customer gets a new message from a seller, there appears a special icon in the header in customer area. Vendors and Store Administrator get notifications about new messages in the notification menu. Besides that, all messages are duplicated by e-mail.
Easy search for orders with messages
Additional filtering option is added to the Orders list section and allows a store administrator and vendor to get a list of orders With any messages or With unread messages.
