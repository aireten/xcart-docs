First of all check if the Messages module is installed and enabled as described in {% link "Activating and deactivating addons" ref_uEnDBBA7 %}.

If enabled and you have the Multivendor module enabled as well proceed to the Messages module Settings page to add special options for providers:

You'll see a screen where you'll need to enable a direct communicaton between customers and providers:

Vendors and Store Administrator get notifications about new messages in the notification menu.

Besides that, all messages are duplicated by e-mail.
Easy search for orders with messages
Additional filtering option is added to the Orders list section and allows a store administrator and vendor to get a list of orders With any messages or With unread messages.
