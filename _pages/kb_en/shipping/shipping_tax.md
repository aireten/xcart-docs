In some countries sellers are obliged by law to set special taxes on shipping charges. If this is your case, you can do it using a special shipping tax setting in X-Cart. 

To find it, please, open the **Taxes** section in your admin back-end (**Store setup** > **Taxes**) and in the _Sales Tax_ tab click on the link to specify tax rates that will apply only to shipping charges.

To set up a shipping tax:
   1. click the the **New Rate** button
      ![new-rate.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4nZM0iOX/new-rate.png)
      
   2. define a zone the tax will be applied to:
      ![zone]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4nZM0iOX/zone.png)

   3. set a tax rate in %
      ![rate.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4nZM0iOX/rate.png)

   4. _**Save changes**_
      
If you have {% link "Tax Classes" ref_pAWOdG8N %} defined, the shipping tax set up will look as follows:

![tax-class.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_4nZM0iOX/tax-class.png)


So you'll also need to define a tax class applicable to the shipping tax you are setting.
