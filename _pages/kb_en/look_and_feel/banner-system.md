The default X-Cart 5 software allows adding banners to the store front-page (home-page) and category pages that is described in {% link "Changing your store's Welcome text and banner on the Front page" ref_Id69E4GT %}. 

If you want more banners that can be added to any page of the store and placed in different locations you can extend the default functionality with the [Banners System](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/banner-system.html "Adding Banners to Store Pages") module (paid for Business and Multivendor, included in Ultimate). 

Once {% link "installed and enabled" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %} the **Banner System** module functionality is added to the **Banners** section (**Content** -> **Banners**) of the store Admin area.

   ![add-banner.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_35tpPrVf/add-banner.png)
   
   Here you can define the banner settings:
   * **Location** : Choose one of the locations available
   * **Position** : In case there will be more than one banner at the same location, specify the banner position in the row.
   * **Banner name** : Specify the banner name here (mandatory field).
   * **Categories** : Choose one or several category pages the banner should be displayed at (optional).
   * **Display on products pages** : If you enable this option the banner will be shown on all the products' pages of the selected category/ies. The option is ignored if no category is selected.
   * **Static pages** : Choose one or several static pages the banner should be displayed at (optional).
   * **Memberships** : Choose memberships if you want banners to be limited to customers with these membership levels.
   * **Show on home page** : If enabled the banner will be displayed on the home page.
   * **Show banner's pagination** : If enabled the banner pagination is displayed.
   * **Show navigation arrows** : If enabled the pagination arrows are displayed.
   * **Display this banner as parallax block** : If enabled the image that is assigned to this banner in 'Banner images settings' section will be used as a background that is scrolled down slower than the main content of the page. The image for a parallax block should be big enough to fit the hight and width of the page it's used at. If you do not set some image for parallax, then the first image from this banner will be used for parallax effect. HTML-banners will not be displayed in parallax block.
   * **Width, px** : You can specify the width of the banner here. It's recommended to leave this field empty for the image banners.
   * **Height, px** : You can specify the hight of the banner here. It's recommended to leave this field empty for the image banners and specify only the hight for HTML banners.
   * **Animation speed, in seconds** : Specify the preferred animation speed in seconds in this field.
   * **Delay, in seconds** : Specify the preferred delay in seconds in this field.
   * **Rotation effect** : Choose one of the available rotation effects for the banner.
   * **Enabled** : If enabled the banner is displayed in the storefront.
   
   Click **Save** or **Save & Close** when you are done. You'll see the newly created banner in the list.
