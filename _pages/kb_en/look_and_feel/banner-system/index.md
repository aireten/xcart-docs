The default X-Cart 5 software allows adding banners to the store front-page (home-page) and category pages. If you want more banners that can be added to any page of the store and placed in different locations you can extend the default functionality with the [Banners System](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/banner-system.html "Adding Banners to Store Pages") module (paid for Business and Multivendor, included in Ultimate). 

This section is devoted to both default and extended functionality. Please read further for a detailed guidance:
