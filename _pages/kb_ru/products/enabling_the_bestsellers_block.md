You can configure your X-Cart 5 store to show a block with the most popular products (the ones purchased the most often) - the so-called "Bestsellers" block. This feature is available through the use of the **Bestsellers** module by X-Cart team. To use the feature, make sure this module is installed and enabled:![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389774/8719209.png)To configure the appearance of the "Bestsellers" block, you need to adjust some module settings:

1.  Go to the "Bestsellers" module settings page by clicking the **Settings** link.

    The page looks as follows:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389774/8719212.png)
2.  Adjust the module settings as you require. Once you're done, be sure to save the changes by clicking **Submit**.
    The module settings are as follows:

1.  *   **Display the list of bestsellers in** (_the main column_ / _a side box_): Use this setting to define the location of the "Bestsellers" block. Choose "_the main column_" if you want bestsellers to be displayed in the central area of the Home page:
        ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389774/8719214.png)
        Choose "in a side box" if you want the block to be displayed in the sidebar of your store's website:
        ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/6389774/8719215.png)

    *   **Number of products in the bestsellers list**: Use this setting to specify the maximum number of products that can be shown in the "Bestsellers" block. For example, in the screenshots above the "Bestsellers" block shows three products; that is because the "Number of products in the bestsellers list" was set to "3" when we made the screenshots.
