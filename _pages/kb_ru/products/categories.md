It's not a secret that to improve customer experience and to make the site navigation easier it's better to organize products into categories. This section provides information on how to add categories to your store manually. Please note that you can also add categories via {% link "import" ref_VXdfNsVw %}. 

{% toc In this article: %}

## Adding a new category

To add a new category you need to go to the _Categories_ section of your store admin area (**Catalog** > **Categories**), click the **New Category** button, name the category in the field that will appear and _**Save**_ the changes. 

![new.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6rpDdput/new.png)

You'll see the category you've just created in the list. Categories are displayed on the store home page in the order of appearance in the list, so change the category position if necessary. 

![list.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6rpDdput/list.png)

To edit the category further click on the category name. Use the fields in the **Category Info** tab to provide information about the category. The only required fields are _Category name_ and _Parent category_.

* Description: A cateory description that will be displayed on the category details page.
* Clean URL: The category page Clean URL (for SEO purposes).
* Category page title: The title to be used in the title bar of this category details page (for SEO purposes). If the field is left blank the category name will be used as Page Title.

* Memberships: Membership levels to which this category should be available. Non-members and users belonging to other membership levels will not be able to see the category on the storefront.
* Enabled: Whether the category should be displayed on the storefront. Uncheck this option to temporarily remove the category from the storefront (Store visitors will not be able to see it).
* Classes for product filter: Define what attributes will be included into the {% link "product filter" ref_6e82A7rL %} block on a category page in the store front-end

Click **Update** to save the changes.

## Adding a subcategory

To add a subcategory you should do almost all the same as to add a category, as a subcategory is a category in fact but of a lower level. So go to the Subcategories tab on the category details page, click the New Category button and follow the procedure described [above](https://kb.x-cart.com/products/categories.html#adding-a-new-category "Product Categories").

## Adding product to a category

To add a product to a category go to the _Product_ tab on the category details page and click the **Add product** button. You'll be redirected to the _Add products_ page (**Catalog** > **Products** > **Add products**) where you can {% link "add products" ref_fhzzxDTy %} to the category one by one. As you understand it is annoying to update/add each new product via the Admin interface. Instead, you can import products as described in {% link "How to import data" ref_glDc6kA1 %} to make the process faster.

## Adding featured products

Use the _Featured Products_ tab on the category details page to add featured products to a category. For more info on the featured products set-up please fere to {% link "Adding featured products" ref_4iFdpTdv %}.

## Categories representation

By default the categories block is displayed in the left side column on the home page. 

![home.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6rpDdput/home.png)

It's possible to change the categories block location using the [webmaster mode](https://devs.x-cart.com/webinars_and_video_tutorials/using_webmaster_mode_in_x-cart_5.html "Product Categories"). Also it's possible to remove the categories block at all and add categories to the top menu. You'll get a horizontal categories representation this way. 

To do so you should:

1. Add your categories as menus on the Menus page (**Content** > **Menus**) in the store back-end as described in {% link "Adding new items to your store's menus" ref_BDykFBbw %}.

   ![menus.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6rpDdput/menus.png)

   {% note info %}
   If you want to add a link to a page within your store (e.g. the category page), you can specify it as ?target=category&category_id=4 (relative path) or as http://www.your_store_url.com/cart.php?target=category&category_id=4 (absolute path).
   Also the '{_category_name_}' shortcut value will lead to the category page.
   {% endnote %}

   Make sure the category menus are enabled and go in a proper order. Turn all unnecessary menus off to make the menu bar more attractive.

2. Add a submenu if necessary

   ![submenu.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6rpDdput/submenu.png)

3. Change the home page and default page layout on the _Layout_ page (**Look & feel** > **Layout**) in the store back-end.

   ![layout.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_6rpDdput/layout.png)

4. Check your new site layout.

{% note info%}
It's also possble to move the categories list to the horizontal bar using the [Horizontal Flyout Categories Menu](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/horizontal-flyout-categories-menu.html "Product Categories") module. It's easier in set-up.
