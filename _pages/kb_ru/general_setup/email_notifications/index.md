Your store can detect various types of events and notify users about these events by email. For example, your store sends email notifications when someone creates a user profile at your store, when this profile is modifed, when a new order is created, then every time the order status is changed, and so on. Some notifications are sent to the store staff (like the site administrator, sales department, customer service, etc.), others - to the store’s customers (namely, the users who created an order, the users whose profile is modified and so on). 

A full list of e-mail notifications available in your store you can see in the **Store setup** -> **Email notifications** section of the admin area.

Here you can enable/disable and edit notifications. 

Admin notifications are marked with an ON/OFF trigger in the 'Administrator' column. Customer notifications are marked with an ON/OFF trigger in the 'Customer' column, respectively. Some of the notifications are sent both to the store staff and customers, others only to the store staff or customers. Each email notification is titled and has a mention that describes a purpose of the notification.

Email notifications that are added by modules installed to the store have the module name in a notification title. Such notifications are added and removed automatically when a module in question is installed or deleted/disabled.
